This is a Python to-do-list that can handle and perform:
- Task creation
- Task deletion
- Task editing
- Setting time for tasks
- Creating sub-tasks
- Adding notes to tasks
- Adding tags to tasks, allowing them to be grouped later
- Searching for specific tasks

This is another project I originally worked on in 2023 but only recently uploaded to GitHub.
